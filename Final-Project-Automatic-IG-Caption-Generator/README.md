# Project: Self-Generated Instagram Captions

## Overview
According to Forbes, the number of social media users worldwide has swelled to 4.9 billion globally for the year of 2023 (Forbes, 2023). Across platforms, approximately 50 million are self-proclaimed ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù, those who utilize platforms to make some form of income. Influencers constantly compete for attention in the world of social media, and victory heavily relies on the quality of their content, especially the quality of their captions.

In this project, I will be using the [Instagram Images with Captions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prithvijaunjale/instagram-images-with-captions) dataset from Kaggle to fine tune a pretrained model on Hugging Face that can generate high quality IG-like captions for photos automatically. 


## Model Selection
1. encoder-decoder model which has not been fine-tuned for image captioning.  
    - For image_encoder_model = **"google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k"** 
    - For text_decoder_model = **"gpt2"**
2. encoder-decoder model which has been fine-tuned for image captioning. 
    - For image_encoder_model = **"nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning"** 
    - For text_decoder_model = **"nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning"**.

The fine-tuning will be done twice for each selected pre-trained model. The first fine-tuning will be done only on the last GPT2 block in the selected model, which means I need to freeze all the prior layers. The second fine-tuning will be done on all the parameters in the selected model.

### Critical Analysis
- **Future Applications**: FlashAttention-2 makes it possible for video generation which require long sequences.

- **Advantages**: FlashAttention-2 works well for longer sequences.

- **Disadvantages**: FlashAttention-2 is not as efficient as FlashAttention for shorter sequences.
